The original Ghosts vs. Monsters is a physics-based game template designed for mobile devices. It was created by Jonathan Beebe and Biffy Beebe for Corona SDK, made by Ansca Mobile, http://www.anscamobile.com.

This is Ghost vs Monsters re-written in an object-oriented style of programming. It's intended as a example of how one might separate functionality within the application.

Many thanks to everyone at Beebe Games and Ansca for making the code publicly available!
